# Computer-Vision-TJ
These are a bunch of labs I did for Computer Vision at TJ. This repo will be private because as of now, these labs are still assigned to students.
These have been really helpful for my understanding of C++.

The first lab was based on computer graphics. The second lab was based on using geometry to find the smallest bounding square of a quadrilateral.
